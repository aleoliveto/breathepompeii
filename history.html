            <h2>The History</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Pompeii was a thriving Roman city located in the region of Campania, in what is now southern Italy.
                    It was
                    founded around the 7th or 6th century BC, and at the time of its destruction, it had a population of
                    around
                    20,000 people. The city was known for its strategic location, as it was situated on the Bay of
                    Naples, which
                    made it an important commercial and transportation hub.</p>
                
            </div>
            <div id="history-right">
                <p>The city of Pompeii was well-organized, with a grid-like street system, public buildings, and a
                    variety of
                    houses, from simple one-room apartments to large, luxurious villas. Many of the houses had frescoes,
                    mosaics, and even heated floors, which were typical of Roman architecture. The city also had a
                    variety of
                    public spaces, such as forums, temples, and theaters.</p>

            <div>
                <p>On August 24th, AD 79, the nearby volcano Mount Vesuvius erupted, releasing a massive cloud of ash
                    and pumice
                    that buried the city and its inhabitants under several meters of debris. The eruption was one of the
                    most
                    catastrophic in history, and it buried the city and its people under a thick layer of ash,
                    preserving many
                    buildings and artifacts for over 1700 years until their rediscovery in the 18th century.</p>

                <p>The excavations of Pompeii have revealed a great deal about the daily life of ancient Rome. The
                    preserved
                    ruins of the city have provided valuable information for historians studying Roman society, economy,
                    architecture, and engineering. The excavations have also revealed the remains of the city's
                    inhabitants,
                    including bodies that were buried in the ash, which have helped scientists understand the effects of
                    the
                    eruption on the human body.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The preserved ruins of Pompeii are now a UNESCO World Heritage site and a popular tourist
                    destination.
                    Visitors can see the remains of houses, public buildings, streets, and even bodies of the
                    unfortunate
                    citizens who were caught in the eruption. The city offers a unique glimpse into the daily life of
                    ancient
                    Rome, with well-preserved frescoes, mosaics, and even graffiti still visible on the city's walls.

            <div>
                <p>Pompeii's story is a powerful reminder of the destructive power of nature, as well as the fragility
                    of human
                    civilization. The city's preservation also serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving
                    historical
                    sites for future generations. It also serves as a warning for the modern world, as Mount Vesuvius is
                    still
                    considered an active volcano, and the possibility of another eruption still exists.</p>
